# The Metalwork Project

I started writing C++ in college, and started doing it professionally in the
embedded space immediately after graduating. Two years ago, I decided to learn
Rust, and since coming back to C++, I've been frustrated with the total lack of
maturity of the embedded C++ ecosystem. The Rust embedded developers get
solutions (for free) to problems that we fight every day in the C++
ecosystem--unit testing, package management, target and toolchain selection,
debugging and debug probe support, and most importantly, integrating existing
solutions.

The goal of this project is to build up standard collateral to make embedded
C++ development better, easier, and faster. I'm not inventing tools, this isn't
an attempt to build up a new ecosystem. I'm trying to use tools that we already
have--Nix, Docker, Conan, CMake--to contribute back to the existing ecosystem
and help to make it better.
